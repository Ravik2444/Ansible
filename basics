Introduction

Ansible is a configuration management and orchestration tool. It works as an IT automation engine.
Ansible can be run directly from the command line without setting up any configuration files. 
You only need to install Ansible on the control server or node. 
It communicates and performs the required tasks using SSH. No other installation is required. 
This is different from other orchestration tools like Chef and Puppet where you have to install software both on the control and client nodes.
Ansible uses configuration files called playbooks for a series of tasks. The playbooks are written in YAML syntax.
Due to the ease of use, Ansible is rising in popularity as an IT automation tool.

Prerequisites

1. Installation (Ubuntu)
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
$ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install ansible

After installation we can check using the following command

$ ansible --version
ansible 2.0.0.2
  config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
  configured module search path = Default w/o overrides

2. python 2.6 or above must be installed
$ python --version
    Python 2.7.12
    
3. Configure ssh
To access the nodes we must generate ssh key on control and copy it to other machines(nodes) under authorized_keys.

Ansible command syntax:
ansible <server/hosts> -m <module_name> -a arguments

Creating Inventory
In Ansible, the inventory represents the machines that Ansible will manage. The list of machines in the inventory can be found out through the following command:
$ ansible --list-hosts all

/etc/ansible/hosts is the default path for hosts after ansible installation. We can create file based on our choice and pass it through -i flag.
$ ansible -i new_inventory.txt --list-hosts all

We can modify ansible.cfg file if we don't want to point to inventory every time.

[defaults]
inventory      = /etc/ansible/new_inventory.txt
OR
inventory = ./new_inventory.txt

Declaration of nodes in inventory
We can declare the nodes sequentially or we can group it under different categories.
Nodes under different group can be listed by passing group name as below
$ ansible --list-hosts webserver
 hosts (2):
    app01
    app02
    
We can ping all the nodes using inventory
$ ansible all -m ping
172.31.12.219 | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
13.232.177.65 | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
172.31.9.228 | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}

Success means the control machine is able to run the ping command on all the machines in the inventory.

ls command can be run using below command
$ ansible all -m command -a 'ls'
172.31.12.219 | SUCCESS | rc=0 >>
snap

172.31.9.228 | SUCCESS | rc=0 >>
snap

13.232.177.65 | SUCCESS | rc=0 >>
snap
